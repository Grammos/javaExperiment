# javaExperiment

This repository it's been created just to play with java language. In this repo you may see college stuff, the stuff that we used and use to learn in java!

The Automjeti folder can tell you how abstract classes work, also there you can find interface (and other interesting stuff)!


The Libri folder can teach you about everything that the Automjeti taught you but in this folder you may find also how to write into a file, read and save it! 

If you don't understand something or u see mistakes please let me know!

Happy coding, cheers :)!
